# Unity3D_Magnus_Effect_Simulation
An implementation of the Magnus effect in unity in 3D. Roughly simulates the behavior of rotating spheres like you can see in soccer, baseball and such sports. There is also an implementation on changing or stopping the timescale to better see the movement of the balls.
